# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Created a main page "index.html" to display all the menu.
User can register/login/logout
Items in cart are rembered with respect to user (Cart items stored in DB)
Orders can be stored along with payment in future to track previous orders of a particular user.
Still size could have been segregated, but to finish the functionality couldn't focus on others.
